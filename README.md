# dism-drvbackup
A DISM tool that makes a backup of all your drivers.

- For restoring the drivers, use my another tool called [drvrestore](https://github.com/lucmsilva651/drvrestore).

## Use
Just run the "backup_drivers.cmd" file and wait for DISM to make the backup. All the drivers will be located in the system root drive, at the "Backup_Drv" folder.
